For my game project, I will create a Top Down Scrolling Shooter called "Escape the Black Flag!"
The user controls Captain Cook's ship as he sails towards port with a hull full of gold! 
To reach his destination with the cargo intact, Captain Cook must fight his way through a fleet 
of murderous pirates and their infamous captain: Blackbeard!

The player can advance levels by killing a certain amount of pirates without losing all of their
health points. Health points are lost when the ship is struck by enemy cannonballs or collides with
obstacles. If the player destroys the necessary amount of pirate ships, the game will advance to 
the Boss level. In this level, the player will no longer be moving forwards on the ocean and will 
face off against Blackbeard's much larger enemy ship. Blackbeard will possess new, more powerful
weaponry and will have many more health points.To win the game the player must defeat Blackbeard 
without losing all of their health points. 
Arrow keys will allow the player to move Captain Cook's ship forwards, backwards, left and right.
In the drone level, the ship will constantly move forwards at a steady pace. The enemies will be 
relatively weak, and will move side to side on the screen, firing cannonballs periodically.
The space bar will fire the boat's forward-facing cannons. 
In the Boss level, the ship will be stationary until the player presses an arrow key.
